# betterchainmail

Minecraft mod that makes chainmail armour better. Chainmail armour is rather
difficult to obtain in Minecraft, but is worse than iron armour making it pretty
much useless. This mod buffs the armour such that it's similar, but slightly
different than diamond.

Specifically, the new armour values are `4, 6, 8, 4` and the set has a toughness
of `1.0f`.
